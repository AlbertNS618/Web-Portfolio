                    <p class="para">The flatback turtle is named for the relative flatness of its shell, 
                        one of the characteristics that distinguish it from the other sea turtles around the world. 
                        Most sea turtles migrate extremely long distances, travelling across entire ocean basins multiple times throughout their lives. 
                        The flatback turtle, however, has a much smaller range, is the only sea turtle that does not visit the Americas, 
                        and is restricted to the coastal waters of Australia and Papua New Guinea.

                    <p class="para">The green turtle is the largest species in the family of hard-shelled sea turtles and second largest to the leatherback turtle among all sea turtles. 
                        Its common name comes not from the color of its skin or shell, which is common among most sea turtle species, but from the greenish color of its fat. 
                        The green turtle is the only sea turtle that is a strict herbivore, 
                        and its diet of seagrass and algae may contribute to the green fatty tissue.

                    <p class="para">The Kemp's ridley turtle is the most endangered sea turtle in the world, despite the fact that females of this species nest more often than other animals. 
                        Its common name comes from Richard M. Kemp, a Floridian fisherman and naturalist who first submitted the Kemp's ridley for identification in 1880. 
                        Today, the Kemp's ridley can often be found in nearshore waters of the Gulf of Mexico where males and females have plenty of space for feeding and breeding.

                        the leatherback turtle is the largest living turtle on the planet. 
                        Unlike all other marine turtles, the leatherback turtle does not have a hard, bony carapace (shell). 
                        Instead, as its name implies, it has a tough, 
                        rubbery shell that is composed of cartilage-like tissues.
