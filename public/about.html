<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I'm currently 20 years old, studying at Binus University majoring in Computer Science.
  Why i decided to major in Computer Science is because i was curious of what goes behind a software and how does it work.
  In High School, i joined a computer club where i learned a coding languange called pascal.
  Even though it's just a really basic languange, i really loved how i can make something in my computer.
  So after that, it made me curious about how app in my phone work, how websites work, etc.
  Those experiences lead me to where i am right now.
